    <h1>Our Story & Mission</h1>
    <p>
      Empowering Futures was born from a simple, powerful belief: every child deserves access to quality education.
      Witnessing the stark educational disparities in India—driven by poverty, lack of infrastructure, and social
      barriers—we decided to act. Our mission is to provide free, high-quality, and holistic education to
      underprivileged children, empowering them to build a better future for themselves and their communities.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="light-blue">
    <h2>The Challenge We Address</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of access to proper schools and learning materials.</li>
      <li>High dropout rates due to economic pressures.</li>
      <li>Inadequate infrastructure and a shortage of trained educators.</li>
      <li>Socio-cultural barriers that disproportionately hinder girls' education.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="gradient-green">
    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      We envision an India where every child, regardless of their background, has the opportunity to receive
      an education that nurtures their mind, body, and character, enabling them to become confident,
      responsible, and future-ready individuals.
    </p>

    <img src="president.png" alt="Founder Mohammed Mutahir" class="founder-img">
    <h3>Mohammed Mutahir</h3>
    <p style="font-weight:600; margin-bottom:20px;">Founder & Secretary, AN-NAHDI Educational Trust</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem
      <br><br>
      The journey of AN-NAHDI Educational Trust began with a spark of inspiration — a young man named Wali Rehmani from Kolkata, whose vision for meaningful education deeply moved me. His efforts reminded me that true change begins with one sincere intention and a heart full of purpose.
      <br><br>
      I reflected upon his work and thought, "Why not have a school like this in our own city — a place where knowledge, character, and faith are nurtured together?" This thought became a mission. Through continuous surveys and heartfelt connections with the community, I witnessed the immense potential within underprivileged children — a potential too often stifled by the lack of access to quality education.
      <br><br>
      This city — the land of Tipu Sultan, known for its courage, knowledge, and legacy — deserves an educational movement that revives that same spirit. A movement that offers free, high-quality, and contemporary education to poor and orphaned children, empowering them with both worldly skills and spiritual strength.
      <br><br>
      At AN-NAHDI, our aim is not only to educate minds but also to enlighten hearts — to nurture children who grow up with confidence, compassion, and character rooted in values.
      <br><br>
      My purpose in establishing this trust has always been to earn the pleasure of Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala through sincere service to mankind — especially to the underprivileged and the most vulnerable among us.
      <br><br>
      May Allah grant barakah in this mission, accept our humble efforts, and make AN-NAHDI Educational Trust a beacon of light and opportunity for generations to come.
      <br><br>
      — Mohammed Mutahir<br>
      Founder & Secretary<br>
      AN-NAHDI Educational Trust
